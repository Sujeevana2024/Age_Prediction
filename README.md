Age_Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs age prediction using machine learning models. 
The goal of this project is to predict the age of abalone based on a variety of physical features.
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of abalone is determined by cutting 
the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. 
Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.

Project Overview
The Age_Prediction.ipynb notebook walks through the following steps:
1.Data Loading and Exploration: Import the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the data.
2.Model Selection: Apply different machine learning models such as:
-Linear Regression
-Decision Trees
-KNN Regression
3.Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (RMSE, R-squared) and compare their performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
Results: Present the final model and interpret the results.

Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

--Python 3.x
--pandas
--numpy
--scikit-learn
--matplotlib
--seaborn
--jupyter
